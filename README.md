# Brotato-BFX

BFX is a library of effects (FX) and misc utils for modding Brotato. It's intended for use with ModLoader, acting as a dependancy for other mods to build off of.

BFX was originally built for use with Invasion, but can be used with other Brotato mods too.

ATOW, BFX is still in its infancy, so there are no docs beyond comments in the code.
